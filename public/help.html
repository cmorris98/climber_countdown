        <h1>Welcome to Climber Countdown</h1>
        <br>
        This application is meant for climbing competitions. In a nutshell you set the appropriate settings via the settings menu and hit Start.
        The application will count down until the competition starts and let you know when climbers should be in ISO and when the first
        climbers should come out to the chairs. It is recomended this application be run from a computer that has an internet connection
        and is syncing time from an internet time source (all modern computers, phones, and tablets fit this criteria). Multiple computers, phones, and tablets 
        will be synced as long as all the settings are the same. Once the settings of the primary computer are set, the link can be shared with others
        which will automatically populate the same settings. 
        This allows all volunteers, athletes, and spectators to have a synced timeclock availale if desired.
        <br>
        <br>
        If necessary the application will run without an internet connection by first downloading the source repository from 
        <a href="https://github.com/cmorris98/climber_countdown/archive/master.zip">here</a>
        then unzipping and opening the index.html file inside the public directory.
        <br>
        <br>
        Here is a descrption of the settings available.
        <ul>
            <li>Climb Seconds: Number of seconds the climber has to complete the climb</li>
            <li>Transition Seconds: Number of seconds you would like for the transition period bewteen climbs. Set to 0 to turn off transitions.</li>
            <li>Comp Start Time: The time at which the competition will start represented in hh:mm 24 hour format.</li>
            <li>Cock Drift: This displays your computers clock difference with the actual time to help in figuring out timer sync issues.</li>
            <li>QR Code: This will generate a code that someone can scan with their mobile device that will send them to this website with the proper settings
                already configured. This is handy for some judges/volunteers to have a clock with them during the competition.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Troubleshooting
